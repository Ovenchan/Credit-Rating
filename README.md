Welcome to our project!

Our project mainly focuses on enterprise credit rating. 
It will train three machine learning models :
Decision tree model inside "Decision Tree.ipynb", Neural Network model inside "Neural Network.ipynb" and Ensemble learning model inside "Ensemble Learning.ipynb".

To start the project, you should first compile and run "Data Processing.ipynb",and it will process the raw data from "rating.csv". After that, you'll get "test_set.csv" and "train_set.csv", which contains the test set and train set. However, the name of the variables in the csv is renamed from its original name. To see the original names, you can refer to "Variables.xlsx".

Then, you can run the three other ".ipynb" files as you like. They'll all give you outcome of each model. Our final model is contained in "Ensemble Learning.ipynb". Furthermore, we have made a prediction based on the unlabeled data from "nonono.csv" via the final model and the outcome is stored to "finalpred.csv".

Last but not least, if there is any error, please first check if you have installed all the packages. If it still exists, please contact us at jh2518252499@sjtu.edu.cn.

Enjoy your journey in our project!
